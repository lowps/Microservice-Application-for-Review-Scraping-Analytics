It’s my birthday, I asked the person at the drive-through if I could use my reward and she told me yes. Took my payment and then I waited about an additional 10 minutes for my one sandwich, For me to leave the location and the sandwich should be wrong. I asked for napkins and when I did so I got handed a lot of them like toilet paper. When I re-entered the drive-through lane, it took me an additional 16 minutes to re-order the sandwich. Upon arriving at the window, I was handed the bag that was soaking wet with the sandwich in it. I called to try and speak to the manager and got told that she was busy so I just got put on hold.

There are always smiles and lots of happy chatter going on, but today was different. Today they were short staffed for whatever reason, and they were not short on orders. The two employees, Brook and Caden, handled everything so professionally to keep the store going. I wanted to point them out because they conducted themselves so well, keeping smiles on their faces and not showing frustration, which no doubt was there.",Food:5 | Service:5 | Atmosphere:4

I placed my order through the app and when I got to the speaker I was told they don’t brew dark roast after a certain time. I placed my order at 10am… I was disappointed and they coffee that I was given was not fresh at all. The sandwich I purchased was even worse. It was completely cold and seemed like it was sitting on the counter for awhile. When I got to the window, there was no warm greeting or smile either.
All in all, I was completely disappointed in my visit to this location.",Food:1 | Service:1 | Atmosphere:1

The inside is super clean. I was greeted almost immediately as it wasn't real busy. I gave my order and was promptly rung up. They didn't call my name when my order was ready so I wasn't quite expecting that. I wasn't sure if it was my order or someone else's. My coconut milk latte was hot & tasty. It was nice to sit inside as a storm rolled in, taking a breather after work and before heading home.",

Okay a little edgy she was, it was 1pm on Sunday I was behind two cars not exactly overwhelming conditions but she was done playing nice.
I picked up my 2 coffees, one was completely wrong and the other should be renamed it was so missing the mark.
I entered the store for the one remake. As soon as the girl saw me, she knew what they did wrong. There were 4 girls no customers, no explanation why it’s so bad. I paid 13 plus and they were worth 5. I could buy the same quality at circle k .  They lack of energy and ability to make high end coffee.
I don’t mind paying for what I’m supposed to get.

The service is still great except that now nobody will stay working for the new manager so it’s almost always new employees so now only sometimes my coffee is right. But mostly I liked knowing everybody. And she took ask the hood furniture out from in front of the place. It was cool. But I knew things were going to go wrong when I saw her reinterviewing the good employees. Nobody needs that. It’s sad.

I pulled around to the front to walk in and the door was locked. An employee or manager walked up didn't acknowledge me and unlocked the door locked the door back up in front of me as I was asking if they were closed. Mind you it's 630 by now and they supposedly open at 5:30.  The service at this location is continously a negative star rating for me. Save yourself the stress and go to another location!

This happened once couple of days ago and I let it slide, but today it happened again and it just made me very upset. I guess that was the last time I got a coffee there. Shame! And most of the time if they give me an option to leave them I tip I do without a hesitation, but not themselves without my approval. I'm wondering if it happened to anyone else at that location.",

Cove road slams the window in your face after handing you your items and doesn’t ask if you need napkins or straw. They roll eyes or have an attitude if you do ask for one, I don’t get it you work at a place that sells mainly drinks SO OFFER A STRAW!

And I told her that it’s for drive thru and I came inside to pick it up. She didn’t even let me finish speaking. She cut me off mid sentence and screamed NAME.

26,"5932 SE Federal Hwy, Stuart, FL 34997",Prod. by GygaHurts,2023-06-05,1,"Me and my wife have been loyal customers to this location for a couple years now. We used to go near daily that dropped to weekly, and most recently we would give them the benefit of the doubt and go about once a month. Im not sure what happened to this location but it has absolutely nose dived in quality. Your coffee will either taste like burnt grounds or straight up milk with no in between.

We aren’t even very picky, we usually take what we get even if its not perfect but theres a massive difference between not perfect and straight up gross. We don’t have complicated orders and tipped every single time. But for over priced coffee, im going to go somewhere else that will make it correct.

Side note: all the nice and great employees no longer work there which makes me think this is absolutely a management issue. Nothing against anyone who works there now, its most likely not their fault.

Its a bit disappointing as this is such a convenient location but we won’t be back, maybe ill try again in a year and see what has changed.

Edit: adding this edit after the “owner” responded. Yeah dude obviously the drinks can be remade but at a certain point when every single drink needs to be remade it can make the customer feel kinda bad or weird. I don’t want whatever free stuff you’re going to offer me from the email you listed. Just fix your store or better yet, the management here. According to reviews I’m not the only one that feels this way",

It was noisy with that awful loudspeaker pumping out atrocious so-called music, add to that people shouting in order to be heard and limited seating.  Okay!

Let's talk coffee? Awful. Strong, bitter and over rated. Over priced!

The Baristas are friendly. Long wait for order.

Guess why I go elsewhere three times a week? And I spend less for a much better cup of fresh ground coffee from exotic places..Hawaiian Kona, Jamaica Blue Mtn., Papua New Guinea, Central & South America, Ethiopian Yrgicheffe, Rwanda Peaberry, and more!

Guess what? I see the beans! I pick the Beans and they're ground before my eyes, steeped and served quickly, less than $3, and the smiling faces know my name and welcome me warmly.

I have the Starbucks app and I register my Starbucks card so the benefits are stars for free food and drinks and there's always bonuses to double your stars so the rewards are often which is really nice.

Management is doing a poor job staying on top of food ordering in my opinion.  I understand wanting food cost down and not wasting food because of spoilage but if your constantly out of an item order more and figure it out or get another job. Very frustrating as it's been happening for over a year.  Drinks are always done great though. Just please put more effort in the food department.,

These are the first people I see in the morning and they always brighten my day and put me in a good mood.

They know their customers and make a special effort that makes us all feel valued as a customer.  For example they know i like my Starbucks fresh so they know before i get to the register which was brewed most recently.  I see similar behaviors with other customers also.  It's almost like family to visit here.  Store is always super clean and they keep track of workload somehow so there's never a long wait even if the line gets long from a bunch of people wl king in at once.

The  times I’ve been to this Starbucks is when I’m headed south & there isn’t another until Indiantown rd. Each time I’ve been to this store, the wait time at the drive through is beyond slow! If you’re stopping here on a time schedule, you may want to second guess that idea because you’ll be late for sure. I wouldn’t write a review for super slow service however, today when I visited, I was amazed by the lack of customer service skills at this store. The girl at the drive through was not only super rude but apparently heard of hearing as she heard “grande almond milk with SF vanilla” and left out the coffee completely! I ordered a grande latte with almond milk and sugar free vanilla and only received milk with SF vanilla syrup in it and yhey actually charged me for the latte! Sadly, I realized it once I was already back on federal and had to buy another from another store. I’ll never be back to this Starbucks and I really hope they get some better employees.",

They take 20+ minutes to serve a coffee which is rediculous and they tried to say they were busy when they only had a couple people in line.  They also cannot count money.  Two times I was owed money and they couldnt understand what happened.,
82,"5932 SE Federal Hwy, Stuart, FL 34997",Tim Ortega,2019-06-06,2,"Their corporate politics suck which can ruin a simple expensive cup of coffee. Without the company politics the staff is good and you pay big prices even at this store. If being chic is your thing, go for the higher priced, sugar bound brews that are hard to pronounce and so are their chemical compositions.

IF YOU ARE A STARBUCKS GROUPIE THIS STORE IS AVERAGE IF YOU DONT MIND AVERAGE FOR STARBUCKS. OF COURSE MORE AVERAGE IS DUNKIN' D'S AND THERE YOU CAN AFFORD TO BUY A ROUND FOR THE HOUSE!

HAVE FUN!",

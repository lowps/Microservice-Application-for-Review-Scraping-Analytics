"3036 SW Martin Downs Blvd, Palm City, FL 34990",nishant narula,2025-01-10,4,"We were traveling from Miami to Tampa, and during the journey, our infant needed milk. To make the stop more convenient for everyone, we searched for a nearby Starbucks and decided to take a break there. It turned out to be a perfect spot for both the baby's needs and for us to relax before continuing the long drive.

As we entered, we were greeted by festive Christmas decorations that added a warm and cheerful vibe to the place. The ambiance was cozy and welcoming, making it a pleasant spot to unwind. While ordering milk for our infant, we also took advantage of the clean and well-maintained restrooms, which was a big relief during a road trip.

In addition to fulfilling our immediate needs, I was delighted to find the Florida-themed Starbucks mug, which I'd been missing from my collection.

This Starbucks not only served its practical purpose--providing milk for the baby and clean facilities--but also offered a great environment for us to recharge before hitting the road again.",Food:4 | Service:4 | Atmosphere:4
"3036 SW Martin Downs Blvd, Palm City, FL 34990",Jessica Sue Morgan,2025-03-11,1,"The only reason why I am leaving a one star review is because of the wait times. Customer service is wonderful, however, of the 3 times we went this week, I had to wait 20 minutes for our order. Mind you, I have an extremely easy order, 2 venti iced coffees, one with cream, the other with a shot of espresso. That shouldn’t take 20 minutes. I’m not too sure we’ll be back, which is a huge disappointment.",Service:1
"3036 SW Martin Downs Blvd, Palm City, FL 34990",alvorous,2025-02-09,1,"The worst customer service I ever experienced, these people can’t handle pressure and need to find a computer job so they can be away from people. The multi-color hair girl cannot even answer politely to a simple polite question. Obviously cannot do her job and her drinks are the worst. One word fire this crew",Food:2 | Service:1 | Atmosphere:3

"3036 SW Martin Downs Blvd, Palm City, FL 34990",Randall Collett,2025-01-10,4,I like this place. Service usually friendly and fast. They lost the star for the comfort of the inside. Not a place to relax and have a coffee It's only a place to have a coffee to go,Food:4 | Service:5 | Atmosphere:3
"3036 SW Martin Downs Blvd, Palm City, FL 34990",Asacia LaFord,2025-01-10,1,"Absolute worst experience at any Starbucks I’ve ever been to. Waited in an extremely long drive-through line only to get cut off by other cars. So I decided to go inside and somebody took my sandwich when I was standing right next to them and walked out with it, telling her daughter that she took someone’s sandwich and they walked out. What kind of people live near this Starbucks???",

"3036 SW Martin Downs Blvd, Palm City, FL 34990",Amber Fortino Castro,2022-06-10,5,"Starbucks was packed! The drive-thru line was wrapped around the building so I went inside to order. The dinning room was also packed. However, I was greeted as I walked through the door & you could see the smile under their masks, through their eyes. They completed all of the orders, both the drive-thru and inside, quickly and efficiently. I did not hear 1 person complain. THANKS PALM CITY STARBUCKS! Everyone was awesome! I’ll definitely be back soon.",

"3036 SW Martin Downs Blvd, Palm City, FL 34990",john segovia,2024-06-09,5,"Was in there yesterday and they were backed up with food orders.  Miguel was apologetic and kept on checking on my croissants.  When they were ready he gave me a gift card as well for my extra wait. I really didn’t complain about the wait but I’m sure Miguel noticed I was getting antsy waiting.  It was a few dollars on the gift card, but it’s not the amount it’s the thought that went into it that goes a long way for customers. I don’t live in Martin county but was in the area working a special event.  I have been a long time customer of Starbucks and will continue.  Thank you Miguel.",
"3036 SW Martin Downs Blvd, Palm City, FL 34990",jordon taylor,2024-07-14,2,"I walked in and tried to order a coffee. The barista(Alaina) that took my order didn't blatantly say anything negative, however, her facial expressions and demeanor during the whole interaction gave off haughty and annoyed vibes. I became confused at one point after asking a question on the nutritional facts of using oat milk instead of whole milk and Alaina proceeded to brush me off without giving me an anwser and even though there wasn't a single other person in line or in the drive through, she tried to rush me into not caring about the drink and how it would affect my body. I felt like this barista felt like I was not as important as her other responsibilities within the store. I am leaving this review in hopes of the store management becoming aware of a potential problem because while I can brush the whole thing behind me as maybe Alaina was having a bad day, someone else may take this personally. Thank you and I wish Alaina and the other employees the best.",Food:4 | Service:1 | Atmosphere:3

This location has blown me away with their customer service, kindness, and delicious drinks. Every single employee I interacted with today (5:30ish on 11/2/23) was welcoming, patient and so very sweet. Sam helped me out at the register and with my drink recommendation and was an absolute gem of a human being (that Gingerbread Oatmilk Chai is SO good y’all AND it’s dairy free!).

I use the drive-through.  I have never had a bad experience with a barista.  My orders are correct darn near 100% of the time, and when incorrect, they are fixed instantly and with a smile and apology.   Overall, it is one of the better Starbucks locations that I have frequented.",Food:4 | Service:4

She handled the berating by two entitled women very well. Not only that, but the manager on duty did a good job of getting these particular patrons off the property as soon as possible. They were very disruptive of the environment, yet he handled the situation well and made sure all employees were safe in the process. On a general note, readers be weary of reviews posted from anonymous accounts (owned by their employer, too— these two geniuses did not strike me as gastric doctors to put it lightly).",Food:5 | Service:5 | Atmosphere:5

"3036 SW Martin Downs Blvd, Palm City, FL 34990",Gledia Tri,2024-06-09,1,"I went in for a short business casual meeting. First time in this location.

CONS
*Super loud music
*Not relaxing music
*Cold design - gray cafeteria like atmosphere
*Freezing temperature
*Uncomfortable chairs
*Chairs and floor contact is Horrid! Loudest screeching sound against tile floor makes it even more uncomfortable to be relaxed here.

If I didn't know any better I'd think they don't want people to stay in. Strange since Starbucks is generally known for atmosphere.

PROS
*Kind/friendly staff",Service:3 | Atmosphere:1

"3036 SW Martin Downs Blvd, Palm City, FL 34990",Lauren Black,2024-06-09,1,"Every time I visit the Palm City Starbucks I leave disappointed. Today was my last straw... never going to the Palm City location again! I've had ""blended"" drinks that were one giant ice cube, such freezing interior that I couldn't stay even with a sweater and a hot drink, and multiple times when the internet was out. Today, I went between dropping off my son and my annual physical (in the doctor's office next door). I wanted to work for the hour between. Unfortunately, after buying my $8 drink to use their wifi, I discovered that their wifi was down. When inquiring about it, the barista suggested that I go try Panera. However, then I'd feel obligated to buy ANOTHER drink to work from Panera (though she said ""oh it's fine to bring an outside drink in to Panera"" — which I feel too rude to do)... plus, I didn't want to go to Panera since I needed to be next door in less than an hour. What a waste of time and money! This Starbucks does NOT live up to the Starbucks brand standards, that usually offers a superior experience at every other location.",

The wait time for a bagel and a coffee was 25 minutes. I ordered a bagel toasted and with cream cheese. I received a partially cut, warm bagel, with no cream cheese or utensils. I recommend you take your business elsewhere to a place where the workers are professional.",
"3036 SW Martin Downs Blvd, Palm City, FL 34990",Damien McGhan,2021-06-10,1,This has got to be the most incompetent Starbucks I have ever been to. I have been here 4 times because they are right by my house and ALL 4 times they have failed to get my drink right the first time. This last was definitely the last time. The staff is extremely rude at likes to point blame at the customer for inability to follow directions. I’ve had it I’m done. Every other Starbucks in he country can somehow get my drink right but you troglodytes cannot.,
"3036 SW Martin Downs Blvd, Palm City, FL 34990",kirsten jones,2020-06-10,1,Worst experience ever at this Starbucks. Used to be a regular and talk very highly of this Starbucks. This morning at 530 am the lady at the drive through window talked to the lady in the car in front of me for 5 minutes while my order was ready at the window. I would never go back to this Starbucks again or recommend. Slow service. They were clearly talking gossip nothing work related or premier customer service.,

Also oh, I have pretty much given up buying from places but try to get too political. Selling me a product doesn't give you any right to tell me how to think or what to think.

Home realizing I don't have it I returned to the shop asking if an I-pad found the gentleman behind counter reached over, with my pad. Thanking him ?

But there is one associate at Starbucks who never shows decency to his customers, Thomas. Who is always nothing but rude to me when i show the highest of respect when i go to the establishment.

"3036 SW Martin Downs Blvd, Palm City, FL 34990",Christine Munoz,2020-06-10,2,"Well....the pros are it’s spacious and there is usually seating with a big parking lot. The major con is that the staff appears young enough to require adult supervision. Lots of joking/screaming between the staff, borderline racist talk and open use of profanity. Near shocking to be honest. I’ll be calling to speak to the manager on Monday and considering calling corporate. Can’t even say the one on federal is better, but I guess I can’t compare to NYC where adults are hired and NEED their jobs.",

"3036 SW Martin Downs Blvd, Palm City, FL 34990",Rebecca Mongolai,2021-06-10,1,Nick was not a good order taker. He repeatedly kept asking what we ordered because he forgot and kept saying they didn’t have certain ingredients when the drinks are literally made with them so I couldn’t get what I wanted. Once we got to the window he then again asked us what we ordered. He gave my friend whipped cream when she specifically said NO whipped cream for medical reasons. He forgot my other friends pumpkin bread. And gave them both wrong sized drinks. This whole ordeal took about 15 minutes. And the matcha had way too much in it I could taste the powder even after mixing it.,

"3036 SW Martin Downs Blvd, Palm City, FL 34990",Brittany Allen,2020-06-10,2,"I seriously hate when I have to come to this location, they’re constantly out of stock of certain items, don’t change their menu to reflect availability, long lines, & have messed up my order multiple times.

"3036 SW Martin Downs Blvd, Palm City, FL 34990",Ava Carino,2021-06-10,1,Terrible service and rude workers. We waiting 20+ minutes just to not have what we asked for. Our drink was sitting in the back for over 10 minutes and worker laughed when it was handed to us. We asked for a spoon and they didn’t know how to offer it to us so we just didn’t get one and workers went back to doing there own thing.

Then he got our order wrong (whip when we said no whip on one drink and no coffee in our frappuccino for the other). A few days later when I returned I went inside to avoid the drive through and the music was so loud the girl taking my order couldnt even hear me. I asked for an iced mocha and got a white mocha.

"3036 SW Martin Downs Blvd, Palm City, FL 34990",L K,2017-06-11,2,"So I decided to treat myself today cause this week has been very long. I preordered Starbucks on my way into work, picked it up in the drive thru, and proceeded on my way. Decided to read the label before drinking it and thank god cause it literally would have killed me (allergies). I told you my name was Laurel you repeated it back then gave me a drink for Merry. Seriously. So I tried to call the place but apparently the mobile customer I dialed isn't available right now so they need to update both the app and google cause that's some crap. So ultimately I'm going to have to wait till after work, go back there, take the espresso drink I didn't order in and return it and get my card refunded because no way can I drink espresso after 3pm.

This is the second time I've been to this Starbucks but the first mobile order. Needless to say not impressed.",
